        <h1>Marina's Photography</h1>
        <h2>Hello! My name is Marina Ribeiro and I am 23 years old. I was born and raised in Minas Gerais Brazil until I was 7 years old. (sim, eu falo Portuguese!). Since moving here, I have been in Utah my whole life and I love it!! I have an amazing boyfriend named Ryan and two lovely fur babies named Tuna and Kenai. My favorite things to do outside of photography are hiking, camping, painting, paddle boarding, and being outside in general!</h2>
